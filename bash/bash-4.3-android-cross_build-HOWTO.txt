- The Debian/Ubuntu build of bash.

Set the environment variables needed to use Android NDK as explained
in 00_NOTES-env_for_cross_compiling.txt (in the root of the repository).

Building against the ncurses library makes bash more comfortable.
Hence, following the corresponding documentation available in this repository:
- on the build system, build ncurses, following instructions at least
  until the "make install" step
- on the target system, install the ncurses package
To match directories where ncurses-5.9 has been "cross-installed":
export LDFLAGS=-L/system/lib
export CPPFLAGS=-I/foobar/include/ncurses

Go to your build directory.
tar xf bash-4.3.tar.gz ; cd bash-4.3
Apply the following patches through the "patch -p1 < ..." command:
bash-4.3-android-01.patch
bash-4.3-android-02.patch
bash-4.3-android-03-getcwd.patch
bash-4.3-android-07-endpwent_warning_and_default_bin_sh.patch
bash-4.3-android-08-bashbug_bang.patch

./configure $static_conf_args

mv /system/xbin/bash /system/xbin/bash-static
$STRIP /system/xbin/bash-static
make clean
./configure $conf_args

make install
mv /system/xbin/bash /system/xbin/bash-dynamic
$STRIP /system/xbin/bash-dynamic
( cd /system/xbin ; ln -s bash-static bash )

tar cf bash-4.3-arm.tar \
/system/xbin/bash*
#/system/usr/share/locale

Care is needed to install bash-4.3-arm.tar on the target device, as another
vesion of bash may be preinstalled.
Refer to other documentation in this repository (about VIM, as an example)
for suggestions and recommendations about installing without causing problems.

For /system/etc/bash.bashrc and /system/etc/bash.bash_logout,
you can refer to
https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android_external_bash/tree/cm-10.2/etc
as a starting point.
I suggest to add the following alias to /system/etc/bash.bashrc:
alias su='su -c /data/local/bin/bash'

NOTES...
********
Android does not provide a complete locale support.
However, if you want to try it, remove the --disable-nls configure option,
add the option --datarootdir=/system/usr/share and "make install" will put
locale related files in /system/usr/share/locale
********
Remove the --with-curses configure option if you want to build bash without
the ncurses library.

Set the needed environment variables as explained
in 00_NOTES-env_for_cross_compiling.txt (in the root of the repository).

The ncurses library is needed, hence, according to the corresponding
documentation in this repository:
- on the build system, build ncurses, following instructions at least
  until the "make install" step
- on the target system, install the ncurses package

Furthermore, "vimdiff" requires diffutils (see detailed notes at the end
of this document), hence, on the target system, install the diffutils package,
according to the corresponding documentation in this repository.

To match directories where ncurses-5.9 has been "cross-installed":
export LDFLAGS=-L/system/lib
export CPPFLAGS=-I/foobar/include/ncurses

wget ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/unix/vim-7.4.tar.bz2
tar xf vim-7.4.tar.bz2 ; cd vim74

A configure problem may arise with cross-compilation of version 7.3.

To cope with this, you may apply vim-7.3-android.patch through the
"patch -p1 < ..." command; however, this patch is not needed with
recent enough 7.3.x versions and with version 7.4.

Apply vim-7.4-android.patch through the "patch -p1 < ..." command.

Create /system/usr/share/vim/vimrc according to your needs/preferences;
you may want to create it as an empty file:
touch /system/usr/share/vim/vimrc
(I'm providing my favourite vimrc for Android: vimrc-android.)
chown root.root /system/usr/share/vim/vimrc
chmod 644 /system/usr/share/vim/vimrc

tar cvf vim-7.4-arm.tar \
  /system/xbin/ex \
  /system/xbin/rview \
  /system/xbin/rvim \
  /system/xbin/view \
  /system/xbin/vim \
  /system/xbin/vimdiff \
  /system/xbin/vimtutor \
  /system/xbin/xxd \
  /system/usr/share/vim \
  /sdcard/tmp

Care is needed to install on the target system, as another version of VIM
may be preinstalled: as an example, on Cyanogenmod 10.1.x for Nexus 7,
there is VIM 7.2 (however, I prefer my build, mainly due to the usability
improvements provided by my patch, and because it is a newer version).
You may have to rename some files/dirs to avoid collisions and/or confusion:
as an example, this is what I did on Cyanogenmod 10.1.x for Nexus 7:
mount -o remount,rw /system
mv /system/xbin/vim /system/xbin/vim72.orig
mv /system/usr/share/vim /system/usr/share/vim72.orig
mount -o remount,ro /system
Anyway, please remember that there are so many different Android
versions/devices, hence I just can't know all possible setups: please,
carefully investigate your system before installing this package; if you get
in troubles, you are on your own, I do not take any responsibility for this.

To install, perform the following steps on the target device:
- temporarily remount /system as read/write:
  mount -o remount,rw /system
- if you installed a previous version, then carefully remove it, as Android
  will not overwrite old files with new ones
- extract the package in the root directory ("/"): as an example,
  put it in the /sdcard dir of the target system, then
  cd /
  tar xvf /sdcard/vim-7.4-arm.tar
- remount /system as read-only:
  mount -o remount,ro /system

------------------------------
Why vimdiff requires diffutils
------------------------------
:help vimdiff
==> [...] This only works when a standard "diff" command is available. [...]
man busybox
==> "diff" section ==> This implementation supports unified diffs only.
man diff
==> To realize that the default ("standard") diff and a unified diff
     are not the same.
Conclusion: for vimdiff to be useful, replace the busybox diff
with diff from diffutils.
